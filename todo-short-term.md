- Federator prerequisites
  - [ ] `toBuilder` on data
  - [x] local service invocation layer
  - [ ] remote service invocation layer
  - [ ] introduce transformers +codegen?
  - [ ] add `api` section to schema, listing a set of exposed resources and if they're federated
    - [ ] codegen something from it
    - [ ] validate at startup that stuff is actually?
    
- [ ] http client/server
  - [x] server must correctly set response content type for errors (json/plain text) + test
  - [x] client must correctly specify accepted content types
  - [x] client must correctly read errors based on response content type
  - [x] read
  - [ ] create
  - [ ] update
  - [ ] delete
  - [ ] custom
  - tests
    - [x] bad request url
    - [x] non-existing user (should get 404 back with an ErrorValue)
    - [ ] complex url with params (check data escaping)
    - [x] operations with paths
  - [ ] tests should cover all 3 servers, one of them (undertow?) in both sync/async modes
  - [ ] codegen simple clients for operations? should work for federated responses too if we have client-side federated op projection
    - [ ] read operation with path return type must be path tip type

- Docs
  - [x] service quick-start guide
    - [x] simple read
    - [x] search operation
    - [x] create operation
    - [x] update operation
    - [x] delete operation
    - [ ] client
  - Operations
    - [ ] Overview
    - [ ] IDL
    - [ ] Routing
    
- [x] url decoding: try to allow [] and {} in requests; else update all curl examples in wiki
- [ ] update introspection service using builder setters
- [x] add request/response validation
  - [x] Requried stuff must be present. 
    - [x] Data validation (input/output)
    - [x] GData validation (params)
  - [x] Codegen should build @NotNull things (params). 
  - [x] Update library example and wiki
- [ ] introduce consistent naming. Type/VarType/DataType/UnionType etc
- [ ] add enums
- [x] servlet-based server
- [x] `normalizedForType`: any reason for `keepPhantomTypes` to ever be `true`? Also check that sibling projections don't get merged: for (A,B,C,D) diamond and A~(C~D,B~D) projection, D projection should not receive B tail 
- [x] move http servers under common `http-server` folder
- [x] race condition in schema refs parsing?
- [x] better required data validation: if required value is missing then remove enclosing entity, recurse
